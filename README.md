# ML-CNN
## Bangla Character Recognition Challenge
Implemented a convolutional neural network for an image classification task, using LeNet-5 architechture. Numta Handwritten Bengali Digits dataset has been used.
1. Convolution: There will be four (hyper)parameters:
    a. Number of output channels
    b. Filter dimension
    c. Stride
    d. Padding
2. ReLU Activation
3.  Max-pooling: There will be two parameters:
   a. Filter dimension b. Stride
4. Flattening layer:  it will convert a (series of) convolutional filter maps to a column vector.
5. Fully-connected layer: a dense layer. There will be one parameter: output dimension.
6. Softmax: it will convert final layer projections to normalized probabilities.

7. 91% Accuracy was achieved.
